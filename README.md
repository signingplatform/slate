# Introduction

Welcome to the Signing API! You can use our API to access Signing endpoints, which can get your documents signed.

We have language bindings in Shell, Python! You can view code examples in the dark area to the right, and you can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right.

The Signing API is organized around REST. Our API has predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts form-encoded request bodies, returns JSON-encoded responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.
